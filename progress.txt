NSD broadcasting

Server transmits file when connected to from client with
specified port & ip address

I do not have a working service broadcaster for client yet

loop for server to go through multiple files not implemeneted yet

necessary changes:
1. app currently crashes when resumed
2. multiple file transfer
3. check the file that stores what is to be transfered
4. set up screen
5. notifications when syncing
